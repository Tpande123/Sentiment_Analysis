# Introduction: -

To exemplify and different algorithms for the implementation of sentiment analysis. 
Sentiment analysis, also refers as opinion mining, is a sub machine learning task where we 
want to determine which is the general sentiment of a given document. Using machine 
learning techniques and natural language processing we can extract the subjective
information of a document and try to classify it according to its polarity such as positive, 
neutral or negative. We are here implementing Sentiment Analysis for the two datasets of
Amazon Product Reviews and Twitter Sentiment Analysis, and comparing the results obtained
using three machine learning algorithms Logistic Regression, Naives Bayes and Random Forest 


## Prerequirements for both the code files: -

1.) Jupyter Notebook or google collab.
2.) The datasets provided(.csv files) and the image files(.jpg) provided should be in the same folder as the respective .ipynb files.


## How to run the code: - 

1.) Open the jupyter notebook terminal(or upload and open in google collab) 
2.) Navigate to the folder where the zip file is extracted to and open the respective .ipynb file provided in their respective folder. The code and the output to that code will be visible.
3.) To rerun the whole notebook again, press kernel and press Restart and run all. (For jupyter notebook users)


## Link to the datasets used: -

1.) The dataset for the Amazon Product Review Analysis is names as 1429_1.csv and is downloaded from Kaggle. Link -- https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products

2.) The dataset for the Twitter entiment Analysis is names as Twitter Sentiments.csv and is a pruned version of the dataset available at Kaggle. Link -- https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140
